        Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Apple be liable to you

        similar support program), or (2) US$100.00. Some jurisdictions do not

    <!-- Violation section -->

    <section>
      <h1>Violation of These Terms of Use</h1>
      <p>
        Apple may disclose any information we have about you (including your
        identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in
        connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the
        Site, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who
        may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
        unintentionally) Apple’s rights or property, or the rights or property
        of visitors to or users of the Site, including Apple’s customers. Apple
        reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that Apple
        deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal
        process or governmental request. Apple also may disclose your
        information when Apple determines that applicable law requires or
        permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other
        companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that Apple may preserve any transmittal or
        communication by you with Apple through the Site or any service offered
        on or through the Site, and may also disclose such data if required to
        do so by law or Apple determines that such preservation or disclosure is
        reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce these
        Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any such data violates the
        rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety

        You agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion and without prior
        notice, terminate your access to the Site and/or block your future
        access to the Site if we determine that you have violated these Terms of
        Use or other agreements or guidelines which may be associated with your
        use of the Site. You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms
        of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and
        will cause irreparable harm to Apple, for which monetary damages would
        be inadequate, and you consent to Apple obtaining any injunctive or
        equitable relief that Apple deems necessary or appropriate in such
        circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies
        Apple may have at law or in equity.

        any service offered on or through the Site, or (4) unexpected technical
        issues or problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Apple does take any legal action against you as a result of your
        violation of these Terms of Use, Apple will be entitled to recover from
        you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of
        such action, in addition to any other relief granted to Apple. You agree

        location in Cupertino, California USA; other Apple sites may be
        administered and operated from various locations outside the United
        States. Although the Site is accessible worldwide, not all features,
        products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered through
        or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic
        locations, or appropriate or available for use outside the United
        States. Apple reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the
        provision and quantity of any feature, product or service to any person
        or geographic area. Any offer for any feature, product or service made
        on the Site is void where prohibited. If you choose to access the Site

        If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or
        other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable,
        such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent
        necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best embodies the
        intent of these Terms of Use, so that these Terms of Use shall remain in
        full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire
        agreement between you and Apple with regard to your use of the Site, and
        any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings

        performance of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver by
        Apple of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms of
        Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Apple and you or any other
        party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These
        Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights
        or remedies on any third parties.
